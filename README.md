# a99 Mental Health Personal Tracking

## Personal Tracking Description 

Our final project is a mental health tracking app where you can create and keep track of goals you want to accomplish. Users will be able to create an account with a username, email and password which will be entered into our login database. After creating an account the user is automatically sent to create a list of their goals where they are able to delete, edit and check off any item on the list. As well as a settings button that directs them to their account page where they can see their information and delete their account if desired.
